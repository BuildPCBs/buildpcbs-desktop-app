🛠️ BuildPCBs: The Hardware Compiler
BuildPCBs is the world’s first AI + Web3 hardware creation network. We’ve turned the complex process of designing electronics into a simple conversation. Describe a device in plain text, and our system "compiles" your words into physical reality.

🚀 The Vision
In the past, building hardware required expensive software, years of engineering knowledge, and complex supply chains. BuildPCBs removes those barriers. Whether you are on mobile or desktop, you can go from "Idea" to "Manufactured Product" without ever drawing a single line or routing a single trace.

🧠 How it Works
Prompt: Tell the AI what you want to build (e.g., "A solar-powered weather station with an E-ink display").

Compile: The AI generates everything needed for production:

Electrical (E-CAD): Schematics, PCB layouts, and Bill of Materials (BOM).

Mechanical (M-CAD): 3D-printable enclosures and industrial designs.

Firmware: The code that makes the device actually run.

Build (Web3): Stake $BUILD tokens to send your design to our decentralized manufacturing network. Real builders across the globe receive the job and ship the finished product to your door.

💻 The Desktop App (Tauri + React)
The desktop application is the professional "Workstation" of the network:

M-CAD Suite: High-performance mechanical design using a WASM-powered geometry kernel.

E-CAD Suite: Professional PCB routing and electrical verification.

Direct Flashing: Connect your hardware via USB to flash the AI-generated firmware directly.

Marketplace: Publish your designs to a closed network and earn rewards.

🌐 The Network
Everything is tracked on-chain. From ownership and version history to manufacturing logs, the Web3 layer ensures that every piece of hardware is authentic, traceable, and secure.
